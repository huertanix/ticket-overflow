Ticket Overflow
===============

Snowpiercer, but for Google Cloud Support

Ticket Overflow is a Chrome/Chromium extension which lets you find unanswered Google Cloud questions on Stack Overflow and submit them to Google Cloud support as support tickets if you have a Google Cloud Silver, Gold, or Platinum support plan. Using a weird Kickstarter campaign, I bought a month of Google Gold support to send the unanswered questions I find to their ticketed support system and add answers back into StackOverflow.

I'm lazy and not going to do it all by hand; This Chrome extension will let me (and you if you're a baller) take neglected StackOverflow questions and bump them up to first class with a few clicks.
