Ticket Overflow
===============

Snowpiercer, but for Google Cloud Support

Ticket Overflow is a Chrome/Chromium extension which lets you find unanswered Google Cloud questions on Stack Overflow and submit them to Google Cloud support as support tickets if you have a Google Cloud Silver, Gold, or Platinum support plan. Using a weird Kickstarter campaign, I bought a month of Google Gold support to send the unanswered questions I find to their ticketed support system and add answers back into StackOverflow.

The Kickstarter campaign got the attention at some folks at Google and they are now answering questions tagged with google-translate and answering them. Yay! This extension will let anyone wanting to help answer questions find them easily by searching for their tag and filling out a support request ticket if they have a support plan.
