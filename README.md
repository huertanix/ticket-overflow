Snowpiercer, but for Google Cloud Support

Ticket Overflow is a Chrome/Chromium extension which lets you find unanswered Google Cloud questions on Stack Overflow and submit them to Google Cloud support as support tickets if you have a Google Cloud Silver, Gold, or Platinum support plan. Many questions regarding Google technologies have gone unanswered on Stack Overflow for several months even when Google recommends using it if we can't shell out the cash for real support (See: https://cloud.google.com/sdk/). In my opinion and experience, Google just as much ignores Twitter and abandons issues without a solution on it's various support Google Groups, so I want to buy a month of Google Gold support to send as many unanswered questions as I can to their ticketed support system and add answers back into StackOverflow.

I'm lazy and not going to do this by hand; This Chrome extension will let me (and you!) take neglected StackOverflow questions and bump them up to first class with a few clicks.

I'm also cheap/work-for-a-nonprofit so I'm not going to pay for this completely out of pocket and am running a crowdfunding campaign for a month of "Month of Gold." Please contribute to the cause and help confused developers get answers!
